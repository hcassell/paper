#Introduction
We present aircraft measurements of BBOA over West Africa.

Particle size was measured using a PCASP (Bloggs et al, 2004).

Jones et al (1998) conducted several studies in this region, but continental-scale measurements have not previously been made.

A large uncertaintitty in modelling BBOA is the extent to which measurments in the etc 

#Simulations
We simulated the evolution of particle sizes as they are transported away from the source region.

#Methodology

# Results
The simulations indicate that chicken korma is really really nice.

#Figures
Figures go in their own section in a draft paper.

#Conclusions
We have made fantastic insights into the taste of curries. Nonetheless, i still want more curry.
